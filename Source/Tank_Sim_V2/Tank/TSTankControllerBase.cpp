	// These are the ONLY statements this constructor is allowed to grow. The
	// Blueprint shipped these arrays already sized, and the graph indexes into
	// them directly, so leaving them empty would produce
	// "Attempted to access index N from array of length 0" at runtime.
	// Lengths verified identical across all six per-tank Blueprints.
	//
	// This does not weaken RULE 1 or RULE 2: no components are created and no
	// assets are loaded here.

	// Otherwise deliberately empty.
	//
	// The Blueprint (BP_TankController_Chaos) supplies every component and every
	// default value. Recreating them here would re-base the components and silently
	// drop any property not manually copied - the failure mode that sank the first
	// port attempt (see CLAUDE.md section 4).
	//
	// Likewise, no ConstructorHelpers asset loading: FClassFinder on a Blueprint class
	// deadlocks the editor during Blueprint compilation.
